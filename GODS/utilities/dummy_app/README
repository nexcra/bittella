Dummy application that logs the time when it is launched/stopped/killed.
Usage: dummy_app <nodeid> <logfilename> <stopsigno> <killsigno>
	<nodeid> is the application node id used to distinguish nodes in the log file
	<logfilename> is the path to a file where the application logs churn events
	<stopsigno> signal number used to stop the application
	<killsigno> signal number used to kill the application

When launched, the application logs the current time, its id and the symbol 'J'
in the <logfile>. It also outputs its PID on stdout. If signal <stopsigno> is
sent to the process, it logs the current time, its id and the symbol 'L' in the
<logfile>. If signal <killsigno> is sent to the process, it logs the current
time, its id and the symbol 'F' in the <logfile>.

Multiple dummy application node running on the same machine can share the same
log file.

The current time format is: seconds.microseconds
